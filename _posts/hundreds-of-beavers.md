On December 5, 2024 I went to my local independent theater where they were doing a one night only showing of Mike Cheslik's _Hundreds of Beavers_. It's a black and white zany comedy with almost no dialogue and the creators heavily encourage you to watch it while drunk. It was also able to sell out all three screens and had the crowd laughing the entire runtime.

This post will be short and sweet because I don't aim to review the movie. Reviewing a comedy that relies heavily on visual gags is not easy. Instead, this post is a call for everyone to watch this movie. Not only is it hilarious, but it is crafted with love from the ground up. This is a movie that can only be born out of a love for the moving pictures. It is the funniest movie of the year by a long shot and the most fun I had in a theater since seeing _Twisters_ in 4DX.
