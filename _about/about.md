Indistinct Chatter is a film blog run by me, Seth Holloway. I am a life long film fan who lives in Charlotte, NC. I genuinely believe that _Hardcore Henry_ is just as good as _Roshomon_ and would love to talk about it.

I am using this blog as a way to work on my film criticism skills. I have been an avid film watcher for most of my life and enjoy talking them over with friends and family afterwards. In college, I was able to take classes about audio / video production and script writing. These classes opened my eyes to the level of craft it takes to make both good and bad movies and gave me a new appreciation for the medium I love so much. As life went on, I wasn't able to pursue this interest in a professional manner but I continued seeing every movie I could and talking about them on letterboxd. The more I read from others, the more I wanted to give real criticism a chance so here we are!

By day, I am a software developer so when I started this blog I decided to build it all myself! The layout is simple and new features come in as I have time to implement them. If you have feedback, post an issue in the repo. [It's open source](https://github.com/Kynazeras/indistinct-chatter)!
