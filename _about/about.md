Indistinct Chatter is a film blog run by me, Seth Holloway. I am a life long film fan who lives in Charlotte, NC. I genuinely believes that _Hardcore Henry_ is just as good as _Roshomon_ and would love to talk about it. 

By day, I am a software developer so when I started this blog I decided to build it all myself! The layout is simple and new features come in as I have time to implement them. If you have feedback, post an issue in the repo. [It's open source](https://github.com/Kynazeras/indistinct-chatter)!
